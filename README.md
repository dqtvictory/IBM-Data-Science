# IBM Data Science

This repo is just the uploads from my online course on Coursera, the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate. It only includes about 70% of the courses' materials. The rest are done on IBM Cloud's services, like SQL server.

A great introduction to data science for beginners. Highly recommended.
